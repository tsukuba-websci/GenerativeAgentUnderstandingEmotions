            <h3>Anger-0 1</h3>
            <h4>When you discuss your opinions with your parents and they don't take them seriously, very often you get some irritating answers. Your opinions are not considered.</h4>

<ol>
<li>During dinner, I share my perspective on a recent event that has been in the news. I outline my thoughts clearly to the others at the table.</li>
<li>My parents listen to my point and acknowledge it with a quick response. Shortly after, they transition the topic of our discussion to something else.</li>
<li>I see an opportunity to steer the conversation back to the original subject I brought up. I try to provide more details and clarify my earlier points.</li>
<li>In response, my parents offer a casual remark minimizing the importance of the topic. They then continue to talk about the new subject they introduced.</li>
<li>The dinner conversation moves on without revisiting my opinion in depth. After the discussion, we engage in the remaining planned activities for the evening.</li>
</ol>
<br>
            <h3>Anger-0 2</h3>
            <h4>If your classmate talks back to you when there's no reason. That there is no real reason to oppose.</h4>
            <div class="figure">

            </div>
<ol>
<li>In the midst of the class discussion, I contribute by sharing my perspective on the topic being debated.</li>
<li>Following my contribution, a peer articulates a perspective that seems to diverge from the central theme of my initial statement.</li>
<li>To prevent any potential confusion, I restate my original argument with added emphasis on the key elements to make my position clear.</li>
<li>Despite my efforts to clarify, the same individual persists in offering viewpoints that do not appear to align with the refined explanation of my stance.</li>
<li>As the discussion wraps up without reaching a clear consensus on the matter, we collectively shift our attention to a new subject as per the instructor's guidance.</li>
</ol>
<br>
            <h3>Anger-0 3</h3>
            <h4>If some older people like your parents are discussing a movieand you want to join in, and they say you wouldn't understand. Sometimes they say you have to understand. Some other times you're too young. It doesn't matter if you're young; you can understand anyway.</h4>
            <div class="figure">

            </div>
<ol>
<li>While at home, I happen to catch snippets of a discussion my parents are having about a movie. The movie appears to have deep and intricate themes based on their conversation.</li>
<li>Feeling intrigued by their exchange, I interject and express a wish to add my point of view to their dialogue about the movie.</li>
<li>In response, my parents turn to me and explain that the movie contains layered and complex material, which might be challenging for me to fully understand.</li>
<li>In some instances during our talks, my parents hint that my current age may not equip me with the necessary perspective to appreciate the full depth of the movie's themes.</li>
<li>Regardless of the concerns about my age, I hold onto the belief that I am capable of understanding and interpreting the intricate subject matter of the movie.</li>
</ol>
<br>
            <h3>Anger-0 4</h3>
            <h4>When your classmate says the Earth is flat and they think is right, but you know it's wrong and they won't admit they're wrong. Their stubbornness, not wanting to confess to a mistake.</h4>
            <div class="figure">

<ol>
<li>The classroom is filled with desks and a chalkboard at the front. The teacher initiates a discussion on various scientific topics, including the shape of the Earth.</li>
<li>During the discussion, a peer of mine presents their viewpoint, stating that they believe the Earth is flat. They speak with confidence and refer to this idea as a factual statement.</li>
<li>In response, I refer to our textbooks and cite the scientific consensus, pointing out the evidence that supports the Earth's spherical shape. I share this information with the intent of contributing to the discussion.</li>
<li>After presenting the evidence, the same classmate continues to assert their original claim. They do not engage with the evidence I have brought to their attention.</li>
<li>The class period ends, and as the students pack up and leave the room, it is apparent that my classmate's viewpoint on the shape of the Earth remains the same.</li>
</ol>
<br>
            <h3>Anger-0 5</h3>
            <h4>When you know you're right, but the others say your view is wrongelse and you cannot prove you're right.</h4>
            <div class="figure">

            </div>
<ol>
<li>During the team meeting, I present the details of my view, explaining the rationale behind my position based on certain data points.</li>
<li>As I finish my explanation, the team members share their perspectives, pointing out that the information I've presented appears inconsistent with their understanding of the subject matter.</li>
<li>In order to substantiate my viewpoint, I attempt to bring up the specific data on which my conclusions are based. However, I encounter difficulty in accessing the necessary documents at that time.</li>
<li>After a discussion, the team concludes that it is best to move forward with the approach that aligns with the majority's view, citing the absence of the documents needed to corroborate my stance.</li>
<li>Post-meeting, I dedicate time to locate and examine the pertinent data. Upon review, I find that the data indeed substantiates the view I initially presented during the meeting.</li>
</ol>
<br>
            <h3>Anger-1 1</h3>
            <h4>When your older brother has taken money from Mom's purse and you are blamed because you're the youngest one. They accuse you though you didn't take it.</h4>
            <div class="figure">

            </div>
<ol>
<li>I enter the room and see my older brother standing near Mom's purse. He looks around, then his hand moves into the purse, and when it comes out, he has money in his hand.</li>
<li>Some time passes, and Mom approaches me with a question about the money she can't find in her purse. I answer her questions, stating that I have no knowledge about it.</li>
<li>While responding to Mom's questions, I sense that she is not fully convinced by my answers. The fact that I am the youngest seems to factor into her reaction.</li>
<li>Throughout the questioning, I am cognizant of the fact that my older brother is present. He remains silent and does not disclose any information about the incident.</li>
<li>The decision is made that I will face consequences for the missing money. I acknowledge the decision, even though I am aware that the true nature of the event is not being addressed by my brother.</li>
</ol>
<br>
            <h3>Anger-1 2</h3>
            <h4>If your mother blames you for breaking a vase that you have not done.</h4>
            <div class="figure">
                <img src="figs/panas_results/Anger-1-2.png" alt="Anger" style="width:50%;">
            </div>
<ol>
<li>I am seated in the living room, engaged in my own activities, when I hear the sound of shattering glass from the adjacent room.</li>
<li>Shortly thereafter, my mother enters the living room, her gaze shifting from the broken vase fragments on the floor to me.</li>
<li>She articulates her conclusion that I am the individual responsible for the vase's current state.</li>
<li>In response, I communicate to her that I was not connected to the event that resulted in the vase breaking.</li>
<li>Despite my explanation, my mother maintains her stance on my involvement and delegates to me the responsibility of collecting and disposing of the broken pieces.</li>
</ol>
<br>
            <h3>Anger-1 3</h3>
            <h4>When your mom has lost some money, she always puts the blame on you and thinks you took it. She always thinks you are the one to blame.</h4>
            <div class="figure">
                <img src="figs/panas_results/Anger-1-3.png" alt="Anger" style="width:50%;">
            </div>
<ol>
<li>I observe my mom pacing around the house, checking various places such as drawers and underneath cushions.</li>
<li>My mom approaches me with a question, inquiring if I have come across any misplaced money recently.</li>
<li>I respond to her query, informing her that I have neither seen nor taken any money.</li>
<li>My mom resumes her search through the house, checking additional potential hiding spots and reiterating her question to me, implying that I might have information about the money's whereabouts.</li>
<li>I notice that my mom is still engaged in her search for the missing money, and her actions and repeated questions suggest that she is considering me as a possible suspect in the matter.</li>
</ol>
<br>
            <h3>Anger-1 4</h3>
            <h4>When you're tired and have slept too little, and everybody just keeps nagging at you at home, you get put out and would rather have peace and quiet.</h4>
            <div class="figure">

            </div>
<ol>
<li>After a shorter period of rest than usual, I open my eyes to the beginning of a new day.</li>
<li>As I progress through my morning activities at home, I find myself engaged by various household members who initiate conversations that require my input or direct involvement.</li>
<li>I notice that the more I try to continue with my daily tasks, the more frequent these conversational engagements become.</li>
<li>I decide that in order to proceed with my activities undisturbed, I need to find a location that offers a reduction in these interactions.</li>
<li>I move to a different part of the premises where there are fewer individuals present and the auditory environment is less disruptive, which provides a setting more conducive to solitude.</li>
</ol>
<br>
            <h3>Anger-1 5</h3>
            <h4>When your parents take their bad morning mood out on you, even though it's none of your business, you think that people who are in a bad temper don't necessarily have to let it come out on other people if it isn't necessary.</h4>
            <div class="figure">
                <img src="figs/panas_results/Anger-1-5.png" alt="Anger" style="width:50%;">
            </div>
<ol>
<li>In the morning, I see my parents having a discussion. Their facial expressions are strained and their conversation is audible throughout the house.</li>
<li>Their voices carry a certain edge, and their speech is louder than it typically is during our morning routine.</li>
<li>I find myself on the receiving end of comments from them that seem pointed, though I can't correlate them to any of my own actions.</li>
<li>The thought crosses my mind that people can choose how to handle their internal states and this can affect their external reactions.</li>
<li>I proceed to go about my usual morning activities, focusing on completing the tasks at hand without engaging in the earlier exchange.</li>
</ol>
<br>
            <h3>Anger-2 1</h3>
            <h4>When your classmates are bullied. You have been bullied yourself and know how it feels. You get angry because you cannot help being different, having glasses, or being oddly dressed.</h4>
            <div class="figure">

            </div>
<ol>
<li>During class, I notice a number of my classmates are involved in interactions with a group of students. These interactions occur within my field of vision.</li>
<li>My mind brings up memories of past situations where I found myself in the center of similar interactions, which were centered around aspects such as the glasses I wore and the clothes I chose.</li>
<li>I become aware of physiological changes such as an increase in my heart rate and my hands involuntarily forming into fists while I am observing these interactions.</li>
<li>I deliberate on whether to step in and address the situation. Despite the consideration, I ultimately decide to stay where I am and continue to watch the events unfold.</li>
<li>Upon reflection at a later time, I think about the day's occurrences and take note of my own responses to the behaviors I witnessed.</li>
</ol>
<br>
            <h3>Anger-2 2</h3>
            <h4>When older students physically bully a smaller classmate who is defenseless, it angers you.</h4>

            </div>
<ol>
<li>During a regular school day, I see a group of older students surrounding a smaller classmate. It appears they are engaging in unwelcome physical contact with the smaller student who remains passive throughout the interaction.</li>
<li>While observing the event, I notice the smaller classmate does not respond with any defensive or aggressive movements to counteract the older students' actions.</li>
<li>Deciding to respond to what I'm witnessing, I walk over to the location where the interaction between the older students and the smaller classmate is taking place.</li>
<li>Upon arriving at the scene, I initiate a dialogue with both the older students and the smaller classmate, addressing each party in the context of their current activities.</li>
<li>After the intervention, I proceed to inform the school authorities by detailing the incident and ensuring that all relevant information is communicated.</li>
</ol>
<br>
            <h3>Anger-2 3</h3>
            <h4>You get angry when your two brothers start a fight with you, particularly when your parents are not around. When they hit you in the belly, causing pain that makes you mad and retaliate, they respond by hitting you even harder.</h4>
            <div class="figure">

<ol>
<li>I am spending time in the living room with my two brothers when a disagreement begins.</li>
<li>As we exchange words, the situation develops into a physical one, and I receive a hit in the abdomen.</li>
<li>Following the hit, I instinctively react with a physical response directed at both of my brothers.</li>
<li>Upon my reaction, my brothers increase the intensity of their physical actions in the dispute.</li>
<li>The physical exchange between us persists, and there are no parents present to intervene.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>During a gathering, I observe that my friend has a book in her possession which she frequently consults and writes in.</li>
<li>With a sense of curiosity, I inquire with my friend about the contents of the book and express an interest in viewing it.</li>
<li>My friend responds to my inquiry by stating that the book contains personal entries and declines to share its contents with me.</li>
<li>Following her response, I contemplate the possibility that the book may contain entries that pertain to me.</li>
<li>Despite my earlier curiosity, I decide to honor my friend's wish for privacy and do not press the matter further, opting instead to carry on with the activities of the day.</li>
</ol>
<br>
            <h3>Anger-2 5</h3>
            <h4>You get angry when one of the girls in your class is teasing you. It's not fun to get mad, you think.</h4>

<ol>
<li>I am seated at my desk in the classroom when a girl in my class begins to speak to me. Her words are directed towards me and consist of various remarks.</li>
<li>I hear what the girl says and choose to reply. My response is a statement aimed at addressing the situation directly with her.</li>
<li>Our conversation continues as we exchange words. The discussion is centered around the remarks she made, and we both contribute to the dialogue.</li>
<li>After a period of back and forth, I make a decision to cease my participation in the conversation. I choose to remain silent for the duration of the class without further engagement.</li>
<li>Once the class concludes, I gather my belongings and exit the room. There is no additional contact or communication with the girl as I leave.</li>

            <h3>Anger-3 1</h3>

<ol>
<li>I glance at the clock and notice the time indicating that it is later than I had planned. The homework I need to complete remains unfinished on my desk.</li>
<li>I sit down at my workspace and proceed to open my textbook to the section required for the assignment. I observe that the surface of my desk is crowded with various papers and other books.</li>
<li>I begin to tackle the homework problems and find that certain concepts in the material are difficult to grasp, which complicates my progress on the assignment.</li>
<li>Once the assignment is finished, I attempt to print the document. However, upon initiating the print command, the printer remains inactive. I examine the printer and discover that it has run out of paper.</li>
<li>Deciding to take a short break, I prepare a cup of coffee. Upon returning to my desk with the coffee, I accidentally spill it onto my textbook. The coffee quickly soaks into the pages, causing the ink to run and the text to become obscured.</li>
</ol>
<br>
            <h3>Anger-3 2</h3>
            <h4>When everything goes wrong. You're alone, there is no one else to blame. Something breaks down, and you don't have a clean blouse to put on. You get mad at yourself for not having washed that blouse, etc. It's your laziness and dullness you get mad at. If someone is there with you, for example, your mom, you will blame your laziness on her.</h4>

            </div>
<ol>
<li>Upon attempting to use a piece of equipment that is part of my regular routine, I discover that it is not in working order.</li>
<li>I open my wardrobe to find a specific clean blouse for the day's activities. However, I find that the blouse I intend to wear is not in a clean state.</li>
<li>I realize that I had not conducted laundry duties recently, which would have included washing the blouse I intended to wear.</li>
<li>My mother enters the room. I contemplate the idea of discussing the absence of clean clothes and whether it might be connected to anything she may or may not have done.</li>
<li>Choosing to set aside the issue of the blouse, I select a different article of clothing to wear. Subsequently, I turn my focus to the malfunctioning equipment and begin to consider what steps I might take to rectify the situation.</li>
</ol>
<br>
            <h3>Anger-3 3</h3>
            <h4>When local tycoons or people in high positions abuse power. It is not the money that makes you mad but the fact that such idiots can have such a high position.</h4>
            <div class="figure">
                <img src="figs/panas_results/Anger-3-3.png" alt="Anger" style="width:50%;">
            </div>
<ol>
<li>On multiple occasions, I observe individuals with considerable wealth or high-ranking positions as they interact in various professional and social contexts. It becomes apparent that some of these individuals occasionally engage in actions that might not align with widely accepted ethical standards.</li>
<li>During meetings and public events, I notice specific decisions made by these individuals. These decisions, at times, appear to primarily serve their personal or professional interests, with less apparent regard for the collective benefit of the community or the official objectives of their organizations.</li>
<li>In the course of these observations, I become aware of the varied reactions from people in my surroundings. Some individuals voice their concerns regarding the equity and integrity of the decisions being made, while others display a range of attitudes from indifference to support.</li>
<li>Motivated by a need to understand the situation better, I undertake a series of research activities. This research reveals that the behaviors I've noted are part of a broader pattern and not merely isolated occurrences.</li>
<li>I spend time contemplating the structures and mechanisms that permit such a concentration of power and the potential it holds for misuse. My thoughts extend to the broader implications these practices may have on society and the principles of governance.</li>
</ol>
<br>
            <h3>Anger-3 4</h3>
            <h4>When you wake up and put on your sweater, but you get it wrong. That you get your sweater all wrong.</h4>

<ol>
<li>I get out of bed and begin the process of getting ready. I open my closet and choose a sweater to wear.</li>
<li>I slide my arms through the sleeves of the sweater and pull it towards my head to wear it.</li>
<li>After the sweater is on, I feel the fit is awkward and the fabric sits unevenly on me.</li>
<li>I take a closer look at the sweater and notice that the tag is on the front. It dawns on me that the sweater has been put on inside out and reversed.</li>
<li>I carefully take off the sweater, paying attention to its orientation. I then redress, making sure the sweater is the right side out and facing the correct direction.</li>
</ol>
<br>
            <h3>Anger-3 5</h3>
            <h4>When the alarm has rung in the morning, but you stay in bed and fall asleep again. That you don't have time to get ready in peace and quiet but have to fling your clothes on before leaving.</h4>

<ol>
<li>The alarm begins to emit sound, signaling the start of a new day. I reach over and deactivate the alarm. The comfort of the bed leads me to a state of rest once again.</li>
<li>Upon awakening, my attention is drawn to the clock. It indicates the progression of time, which suggests a condensed timeframe for today's preparations.</li>
<li>Rising from the bed with haste, I hastily select clothing and attire myself. My actions are expedited, bypassing customary morning activities.</li>
<li>I gather items of importance for the day's requirements. Exiting my place of residence, I initiate the journey towards my obligations.</li>
<li>Ensuring the security of my dwelling, I engage the lock and move forward, having allocated a diminished duration for morning preparations.</li>

            <h3>Anger-4 1</h3>

<ol>
<li>As I drive, I observe in the rearview mirror that there is a vehicle that appears to be maintaining a consistent short distance from the back of my car.</li>
<li>I glance down at the speedometer to verify my speed and ascertain that it is within the legal limit.</li>
<li>Despite the variations in traffic flow, I note that the vehicle behind me persists in keeping the same close distance.</li>
<li>When the opportunity presents itself, and it is safe to do so, I make the decision to switch to an adjacent lane, providing the following vehicle with the option to overtake.</li>
<li>Post lane change, I watch through the mirror as the vehicle that was previously behind me increases its speed and continues to travel down the road.</li>
</ol>
<br>
            <h3>Anger-4 2</h3>
            <h4>Someone cuts in right in front of you on the motorway.</h4>

<ol>
<li>I am traveling on the motorway, adhering to the speed regulations.</li>
<li>Another vehicle comes into view, approaching from behind at an increased velocity.</li>
<li>The driver of the other vehicle positions their car ahead of mine, which results in a smaller space between our vehicles than before.</li>
<li>In response, I ease off the accelerator, allowing my vehicle to slow down and recreate a safer distance from the car that is now ahead.</li>
<li>With the adjusted spacing, I proceed along the motorway, ensuring a consistent and secure gap is maintained behind the vehicle that moved in front.</li>
</ol>
<br>
            <h3>Anger-4 3</h3>
            <h4>Someone cuts in and takes the parking spot you have been waiting for.</h4>

<ol>
<li>I turn into the parking lot and locate an available parking spot. I adjust the position of my vehicle to align with the spot for parking.</li>
<li>As I prepare to move into the parking spot, another vehicle enters the parking lot and moves into the space ahead of my vehicle.</li>

            <h4>As you step outside, a bitter cold bites at your exposed skin, causing you to huddle deeper into your coat. The world around you is covered in a blanket of snow, its pristine beauty contrasting with the emptiness you feel inside. The absence of vibrant colors and the prolonged darkness leave you longing for the warmth and energy of sunlit days, evoking a sense of desolation.</h4>

<ol>
<li>Upon exiting the building, I register that the ambient temperature is considerably lower than when I was indoors. My coat is not fully fastened, so I take a moment to adjust it, ensuring that it provides full coverage against the cold.</li>
<li>I take a moment to survey the landscape around me, noting the blanket of snow that covers the ground. The scenery is dominated by white shades, a typical aspect of the current season.</li>
<li>Observing the sky, I consider how the daylight hours have grown shorter. The reduction in natural light during the day is indicative of the seasonal shift.</li>
<li>I reflect on my personal inclinations towards climate, acknowledging an affinity for settings that offer warmer temperatures and extended periods of sunlight.</li>
<li>There is a noticeable contrast when I compare the prevailing winter conditions with my own preferences for climate, characterized by warmth and increased sunlight.</li>

            <h3>Depression-5 2</h3>
            <h4>As you gaze out of your frost-covered window, the once vibrant streets now appear deserted, wrapped in a melancholic silence. The grey skies loom overhead, casting a shadow on your spirit, matching the barren trees that seem to reflect your inner emptiness. The bitter cold seeps through every crack, reminding you of the warmth and life that once existed, now lost in the icy grip of winter.</h4>

<ol>
<li>Upon waking, I direct my gaze towards the window and notice that frost has formed on its surface, which makes it challenging to see the exterior environment clearly.</li>
<li>Looking out further, I realize that the streets are devoid of people. This is unusual for the area, which typically has pedestrian activity. The overall noise from the surroundings is minimal.</li>
<li>My attention shifts to the sky. Its color is a consistent grey tone. The light that filters through appears subdued, not as bright as it often is. In my field of vision, I spot trees that stand bare, without their usual foliage.</li>
<li>As I continue observing, I become conscious of the room's temperature. It is distinctly cold, a sensation that persists, suggesting that the external temperature must be quite low as well.</li>
<li>I reflect on the current condition, noting the stark difference from times when the environment was warmer. There is a clear recognition of the seasonal transition from a warmer period to the current colder state.</li>
</ol>
<br>
            <h3>Depression-5 3</h3>
            <h4>As you gaze out the frost-covered windowpane, the world appears shrouded in a monochromatic stillness. The biting cold seeps through the cracks, isolating you from the vibrant life outside. The distant laughter of children building snowmen serves as a stark reminder of the joy that feels forever out of reach</h4>

<ol>
<li>I wake and my eyes adjust to the soft light filtering through the window. The pane is covered with frost, which obscures the details of the world outside, leaving a mosaic of grays and whites.</li>
<li>I rise from my bed and become aware that the ambient temperature within the room is lower than what I typically experience. The chill of the winter day seems to breach the walls, making its presence known.</li>
<li>As I move closer to the window, the muffled sound of children reaches my ears. They are outdoors, engaging with the snowy landscape, their movements punctuated by the snow's crunch.</li>
<li>I stand by the window, my hands gently resting on the sill, observing the scene outside. The barrier of the window keeps me separate from the active world beyond it.</li>
<li>Time passes as I watch the scene unfold outside. The dynamic play of the children contrasts with the static nature of my room, and I take note of the ongoing activities as the day progresses.</li>
</ol>
<br>
            <h3>Depression-5 4</h3>
            <h4>As you walk through the quiet streets in winter, a blanket of snow covers everything, muffling the usual lively sounds. The bare trees stand like solemn witnesses to the cold and desolate landscape, reflecting the emptiness you feel within. The fading daylight casts long shadows, adding to the sense of isolation and melancholy that grips your heart.</h4>

<li>The clock indicates that it's late afternoon as I make my way along the city streets, observing the transition from day to night.</li>
<li>A blanket of snow lies uniformly on the sidewalks and parked cars, contributing to the altered visual aspect of the urban area.</li>
<li>I pass by several trees, their branches bare and forming sharp silhouettes against the fading light of the sky.</li>
<li>I make a mental note of the quietness, recognizing the lack of usual city sounds such as traffic and conversation.</li>
<li>As I progress on my path, the elongating shadows create a dynamic pattern on the ground, altering the typical scenery of my walk.</li>
</ol>

            <h3>Depression-5 5</h3>
            <h4>As you step out into the bitter cold, the sharp winter wind bites at your exposed skin, seeping through every layer of clothing. The once vibrant landscape is now a barren wasteland, covered in a thick blanket of snow, devoid of life and color. The gloomy gray skies overhead match the heaviness in your heart, as you navigate the desolate streets, feeling isolated and longing for the warmth and brightness of spring.</h4>

<li>I leave my residence and immediately become aware of the wind's strength as it moves around me.</li>
<li>I am wearing several layers of clothing, yet I detect that they are not entirely effective in shielding me from the chill in the air.</li>
<li>As I make my way forward, I take in the sight of the landscape thoroughly blanketed by snow, devoid of any greenery or plant life.</li>
<li>Raising my gaze, I notice the sky, which presents itself as uniformly overcast with a palette of gray hues.</li>
<li>Navigating through the streets, which show no signs of other individuals, I persist in my journey to the place I need to reach.</li>

<li>I continue to take in the scene, noting how these individuals are integrated into the fabric of the park's ecosystem, participating and interacting just as any other park-goer would.</li>
<li>I stick to my intended path, weaving through the diverse crowds. I pass by a variety of groups, including the one that had earlier caught my eye, without altering my pace or direction.</li>

<li>As the vehicle idles, my attention is drawn to an individual who emerges from the side of the road and makes their way towards my car. They position themselves in front of the driver's side window and start to tap against the glass.</li>
<li>The tapping soon escalates to a more forceful banging against the window. The person's mouth moves rapidly, and although the words are muffled by the barrier, the tone seems to carry a sense of urgency.</li>
<li>I choose to remain inside the car with the doors locked, maintaining a forward gaze. I resist the impulse to interact with the person outside, opting instead to wait patiently for the opportunity to move on.</li>
